# Contributing to Bibata Translucent
I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## I Develop with Github
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## I Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed Look, update the documentation.
4. Issue that pull request! I will build any changes to the cursors themselves and update the master branch accordingly

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL - 3.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL - 3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/silicasandwhich/Bibata_Cursor_Translucent/issues)
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue, it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
